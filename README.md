#### **Overview**
The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of three machine learning models on the CICIDS2017 dataset for building a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The models we will evaluate are:

1. **Random Forest (RF)**  
2. **Random Forest Retrained on Selected Features (RF-R)**  
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
4. **XGBoost**

#### **Objectives**
- Build a Random Forest (RF) model as the baseline for the Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
  
- Retrain the Random Forest model using the most important features selected through feature selection to enhance its performance.

- Evaluate the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and XGBoost, alongside Random Forest models, to determine their effectiveness in detecting intrusions.

- Compare the performance of all models (RF, RF-R, KNN, and XGBoost) using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their overall effectiveness in detecting attacks on the CICIDS2017 dataset.

- Analyze how well each model handles different attack types and their individual performance in detecting common attack categories such as DoS and web attacks.
